                                I was the youngest intern in the office which was somewhat intimidating but I was able to overcome and make great relationships with my coworkers. 
                                I also learned Python and created a proof of concept application that was designed to run UNIX commands on a given list of KP servers. 
                                I collaborated with my peers to create several PowerPoint presentations that we presented to our peers, managers and sometimes executive leadership.

                                I rotated through four different teams while in this program: The first team was an Automation team where I supported my team with building automation tools to support our coworkers by improving their workflows.
                                The second team was in was called the Interoperability Services team where I supported my their servers and applications they stored by keeping them online, up-to-date and available to members and physicians.
                                The third was called the Pharmacy Services team where I built Microsoft PowerApps, analyzed and reported on data and supported Quality Assurance testing.
                                The last team I worked on was a DevOps team where I supported the spread of DevOps practices throughout KP and helped maintain a Service Desk where our coworkers could request assistance.

                            <p>Working with CodeFu was my first professional teaching experience outside of the Hidden Genius Project.
                                Here I taught computer science to Elementary school students at various schools around the Bay Area like Head-Royce, 
                                Lycée Francais de San Francisco and several more. I taught my students how to build websites, games and Minecraft mods.

                            <p>I was so excited for this internship. The experience was life defining. KP LAUNCH taught me how to be a professional in a corporate environment and cooperate with my peers. 
                            I was the youngest intern in the office which was somewhat intimidating but I was able to overcome and make great relationships with my coworkers. 
                            I also learned Python and created a proof of concept application that was designed to run UNIX commands on a given list of KP servers. 
                            I collaborated with my peers to create several PowerPoint presentations that we presented to our peers, managers and sometimes executive leadership.

                            <h1>KP LAUNCH High School Internship</h1>
                            <p>I started the KP LAUNCH internship right after graduating high school. It felt like the perfect next step in my career journey.
                                Here I worked with a cohort of nearly 20 other interns that included some of my fellow HGP alumni.
                                We learned professional development skills and collaborated on a presentation that addressed the issue of homelessness in our neighborhoods.
                                I worked on a Design Thinking team where I learned about the applications of Virtual Reality in the medical field and created documentation for prototype VR software that would be tested with patients.
                                I also collaborated with my team to come up with new ideas for an exhibit that would be displayed in one of the newer KP buildings.
