                    <p>My drive and work ethic have enabled me to excel in my career and education. 
                    I attended my first boot camp when I was 15 and got my first job when I was 16 with no gaps in employment to this day. 
                    I was able to graduate high school with a 5.0 GPA and several college credits under my belt. </p>

                    <p>It took me a long time to figure out how I can best add value to my community. 
                        I wouldn't have been able to do it without my community pouring value into me so that I could explore and discover the best parts of myself. 
                        My city and my people did this for me in the form of community programs offering opporunities to me and other young Black students. </p>

                    <h1>KP LAUNCH College Internship</h1>
                    <p>I was so excited for this internship. The experience was life defining. KP LAUNCH taught me how to be a professional in a corporate environment and cooperate with my peers. 
                        I was the youngest intern in the office which was somewhat intimidating but I was able to overcome and make great relationships with my coworkers. 
                        I also learned Python and created a proof of concept application that was designed to run UNIX commands on a given list of KP servers. 
                        I collaborated with my peers to create several PowerPoint presentations that we presented to our peers, managers and sometimes executive leadership.

                    <h1>HGP Coding Class @ WOYC</h1>
                    <p>This was my first time teaching a regular class for HGP at another community center called the West Oakland Youth Development Center.
                        Here I co-taught a class of 10-15 elementary school students about coding. My co-youth educator and I worked together to create curriculum
                        to help youth in our community build a strong technological foundation. </p>

                    <p>Brother's Code is a community event that introduces youth and adults of color to tech.
                        Universities, companies and other community serving organizations come together to hold workshops, discussions,
                        demos and giveaways on the Merritt College campus in the Oakland hills. I was given the opportunity to teach coding
                        and robotics workshops to the student attendees. I attended Brothers Code and taught for the next three years.
                        In 2019, I was given the opportunity to teach an adult class on web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Checkout the 2019 highlights <a href="https://youtu.be/64eXNgiYUCQ">here.</a></p>

                        I worked here for two and a half years and earned a promotion to hot prep which means I prepared all of the hot food that went into the salads.

                    <p>The Hidden Genius Project trains and mentors Black male youth in technology creation, entrepreneurship and leadership skills to transform their lives and communities.
                        I didn't fully grasp what I was getting myself into during the interview process. I was so grateful when I got the call that I made it in. The HGP Immersion Bootcamp
                        is a 2-year commitment that starts in the summer, goes through the fall and spring school semester and ends at the end of the next summer. We learned about how to build
                        websites, mobile apps and work with robots. We learned about how to be a professional entrepreneur, how to make the most of that mindset and how to be leaders in our communities.
                        We also gained a brotherhood connection within our cohort similar to that of a fraternity. We built a network of likeminded peers and mentors that would help us achieve our goals
                        and grow into powerful yet honorable young men. </p>

                    <h1>Kaiser Permanente IT Apprenticeship</h1>
                    <p>I started the KPIT Apprenticeship right after completing the KP LAUNCH college internship. I was gifted the opportunity to experience working in an IT environment in a group of 13 other apprentices.
                        I rotated through four different teams while in this program: The first team was an Automation team where I supported my team with building automation tools to support our coworkers by improving their workflows.
                        The second team was in was called the Interoperability Services team where I supported my their servers and applications they stored by keeping them online, up-to-date and available to members and physicians.
                        The third was called the Pharmacy Services team where I built Microsoft PowerApps, analyzed and reported on data and supported Quality Assurance testing.
                        The last team I worked on was a DevOps team where I supported the spread of DevOps practices throughout KP and helped maintain a Service Desk where our coworkers could request assistance.

                    <h1>HGP South Africa Youth Educator Trip</h1>
                    <p>When my mentor called me and asked if I wanted to go to Africa, I was surprisingly unfazed. Not like I had ever been to Africa before.
                        I think a very small part of myself was saying "no way we're going to Africa". It didn't set in until we actually set foot on the home of all of humankind.
                        Not just that, the home of my people. The people that I may never know. Nevertheless, the feeling that overcame me when I stepped off the plane was the feeling of being home.
                        If I had to summarize this trip in a few words, I would say that it was one of the greatest blessings i've ever received in my entire life. We stayed at the Four Seasons in Johanessberg for a week.
                        We visited Neslon Mandela's home, the cradle of humankind and the Apartheid Museum. The purpose of our trip was to visit three schools and teach design thinking workshops. The students welcomed us
                        and I allowed us to get to know them. Their stories exemplified the difference between growing up in the U.S. and growing up there and opened our eyes to our own privilege. We were honored to be in their presence. </p>

                    <p>I started the KP LAUNCH internship right after graduating high school. It felt like the perfect next step in my career journey.
                        Here I worked with a cohort of nearly 20 other interns that included some of my fellow HGP alumni.
                        We learned professional development skills and collaborated on a presentation that addressed the issue of homelessness in our neighborhoods.
                        I worked on a Design Thinking team where I learned about the applications of Virtual Reality in the medical field and created documentation for prototype VR software that would be tested with patients.
                        I also collaborated with my team to come up with new ideas for an exhibit that would be displayed in one of the newer KP buildings.

                        In this program, I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript for the first time and built a website for a local cupcake business.
                        I also learned how to communicate with clients in a professional and respectful manner and represent myself as an individual. </p>
