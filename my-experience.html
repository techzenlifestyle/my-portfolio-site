                    <h1>My Experience - Career</h1>
                    <p>My drive and work ethic have enabled me to excel in my career and education. 
                    I attended my first boot camp when I was 15 and got my first job when I was 16 with no gaps in employment to this day. 
                    I was able to graduate high school with a 5.0 GPA and several college credits under my belt. </p>

                    <h1>My Experience - Community</h1>
                    <p>I unceasingly strive to find new and better ways to support my community, because they are the reason 
                        I am who I am today. Through my community, I was given access to programs and opportunities that I, 
                    and other Black students otherwise would not have been able to experience. Therefore, I take it as a personal 
                responsibility to improve it for the next generation to have even more opportunities than I had.  </p>

                    <h2>KP LAUNCH College Internship</h2>
                    <p>I was so excited for this internship. The experience was life defining. KP LAUNCH taught me how to be a professional in a corporate environment and cooperate with my peers. 
                        I was the youngest intern in the office which was somewhat intimidating but I was able to overcome and make great relationships with my coworkers. 
                        I also learned Python and created a proof of concept application that was designed to run UNIX commands on a given list of KP servers. 
                        I collaborated with my peers to create several PowerPoint presentations for the projects we worked on during the internship. I created a prototype
                        web application that was meant to connect to several given servers and run commands on them at the push of a button. We presented to our coworkers, managers and sometimes executive leadership.

                    <h2>HGP Coding Class @ WOYC</h2>
                    <p>This was my first time teaching a regular class for HGP at another community center called the West Oakland Youth Development Center.
                        Here I co-taught a class of 10-15 elementary school students about coding. My co-youth educator and I worked together to create curriculum
                        to help youth in our community build a strong technological foundation. </p>

                    <h2>Inclusive Community Resources</h2>
                    <p>At Inclusive Community Resources, I supported the elderly and disabled with general needs like grocery shopping, running errands and tending to the house. 
                        This position helped me to work on my communication skills which supported me in future positions with other companies.

                    <h2>HGP Brother's Code Catalyst Event</h2>
                    <p>Brother's Code is a community event that introduces youth and adults of color to tech.
                        Universities, companies and other community-serving organizations come together to hold workshops, discussions,
                        demos and giveaways on the Merritt College campus in the Oakland hills. I was given the opportunity to teach coding
                        and robotics workshops to the student attendees. I attended Brothers Code and taught for the following three years.
                        In 2019, I was given the opportunity to teach an adult class on web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Checkout the 2019 highlights <a href="https://youtu.be/64eXNgiYUCQ">here.</a></p>

                    <h2>Sweetgreen</h2>
                    <p>Sweetgreen is a salad bar that sources ingredients from local farms to bring a healthy eating experience to customers. This was my first real job.
                        I worked here for two and a half years and earned a promotion to hot prep which means I prepared all of the hot food that went into the salads. 
                        This job required me to maintain an awareness of the oven, my prepped food and the food being directly served to the customers so I gained 
                        multi-tasking and time management skills from this position.

                    <h2>The Hidden Genius Project</h2>
                    <p>The Hidden Genius Project trains and mentors Black male youth in technology creation, entrepreneurship and leadership skills to transform their lives and communities.
                        I didn't fully grasp what I was getting myself into during the interview process. I was so grateful when I got the call that I made it in. The HGP Immersion Bootcamp
                        is a 2-year commitment that starts in the summer, goes through the fall and spring school semester and ends at the end of the next summer. We learned about how to build
                        websites, mobile apps and work with robots. We learned about how to be a professional entrepreneur, how to make the most of that mindset and how to be leaders in our communities.
                        We also gained a brotherhood connection to our cohort and all members of the program. We built a network of likeminded peers and mentors that helped us achieve our goals
                        and grow into powerful yet honorable young men. </p>

                    <h2>Kaiser Permanente IT Apprenticeship</h2>
                    <p>I started the KPIT Apprenticeship right after completing the KP LAUNCH college internship. I was gifted the opportunity to experience working in an IT environment in a group of 13 other apprentices.
                        I rotated through four different teams while in this program: The first team was an Automation team where I supported my team with building automation tools to support our coworkers by improving their workflows.
                        The second team was called the Interoperability Services team where I supported their servers and applications by keeping them online, up-to-date and available to members and physicians. In this team I developed
                        a web application I called the "Roadmap Generator" that is designed to get project data from a database and display it for users as a timeline of all their initiatives. I presented this application to my managers
                        and executive leadership and it is still being used by that team today. The third was called the Pharmacy Services team where I built Microsoft PowerApps, analyzed and reported on server data and supported Quality Assurance testing.
                        The last team I worked on was a DevOps team where I supported the spread of DevOps practices throughout KP and helped maintain a Service Desk where our coworkers could request assistance with bugs or enhancements to the shared libraries we maintained.

                    <h2>HGP South Africa Youth Educator Trip</h2>
                    <p>When my mentor called me and asked if I wanted to go to Africa, I was surprisingly unfazed. Not like I had ever been to Africa before.
                        I think a very small part of myself was saying "no way we're going to Africa". It didn't set in until we actually set foot on the home of all of humankind.
                        Not just that, the home of my people. The people that I may never know. Nevertheless, the feeling that overcame me when I stepped off the plane was the feeling of being home.
                        If I had to summarize this trip in a few words, I would say that it was one of the greatest blessings I've ever received in my entire life. We stayed at the Four Seasons in Johanessberg for a week.
                        We visited Neslon Mandela's home, the cradle of humankind and the Apartheid Museum. The purpose of our trip was to visit three schools and teach design thinking. We guided them through a workshop that
                        got them to practice the concept of working together to come up with solutions to problems in their community. The students welcomed us and allowed us to get to know them. Their stories exemplified the
                        difference between growing up in the U.S. and growing up there and opened our eyes to our own privilege.</p>

                    <h2>CodeFu</h2>
                    <p>Working with CodeFu was my first professional teaching experience outside of the Hidden Genius Project.
                        Here I taught computer science to Elementary school students at various schools around the Bay Area like Head-Royce, 
                        Lycée Francais de San Francisco and several more. I taught my students how to build websites, games and Minecraft mods.

                    <h2>HGP Alumni Trip - New Orleans</h2>
                    <p>This was my first trip with HGP. I had never been to NOLA before. We attended and taught a robotics workshop at Colin Kaeperknick's "Know Your Right's" event.
                        My brothers and I had a great time teaching the students and were even blessed with the opportunity to take home a backpack full of merch, meet Colin Kaepernick and explore the area. </p>

                    <h2>KP LAUNCH High School Internship</h2>
                    <p>I started the KP LAUNCH internship right after graduating high school. It felt like the perfect next step in my career journey.
                        Here I worked with a cohort of nearly 20 other interns that included some of my fellow HGP alumni.
                        We learned professional development skills and collaborated on a presentation that addressed the issue of homelessness in our neighborhoods.
                        I worked on a Design Thinking team where I learned about the applications of Virtual Reality in the medical field and created documentation for prototype VR software that would be tested with patients.
                        I also collaborated with my team to come up with new ideas for an exhibit that would be displayed in one of the newer KP buildings.

                    <h2>Hack the Hood</h2>
                    <p>Hack the Hood is a non-profit organization that taught a summer bootcamp on web development and gave students the opporunity
                        to begin their freelancing career by building a website for a small business.
                        In this program, I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript for the first time and built a website for a local cupcake business.
                        I also learned how to communicate with clients in a professional and respectful manner and represent myself as an individual. </p>
